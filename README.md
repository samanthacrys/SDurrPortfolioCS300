* What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, I was solving the best algorithm and data structure for creating a program that can upload, print, and search for courses. This program needed to be able to do this in the most efficient way possible and allow for when there is an update to the course load in the future to make it easier for students to look up a course and see the prereqs for that course as well.

* How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I had to look at the problem as a progression. With the projects first focusing on the runtime analysis and then on the code, it allowed me to take in the three main data structures that we were looking at: vector, hash table, and binary search tree. I could look at how each of these ran and see which was going to be the best. This did require some research, which I did. There were parts that spoke about how, if it is done this way, this could be faster, but that was not what I needed to consider. In most cases, I needed to think about how it could be done at my current level. That helped in approaching the problem because I have to consider that I’m not a 30 year experience programmer, I am a student learning new things. So did my research, looked into the different data structures and went with the one that was, across the board, coming up as the best option.

* How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Most of my roadblocks actually came when turning the pseudocode into the actual code in project 2. While some of it was pretty easy to translate, not all of it was. It was also easy to see where I missed steps that were important or included elements that were unnecessary. When I encountered those problems, I took a step back, looked it over, analyzed what I didn’t understand and would research what may help. In some cases, it was as simple as me forgetting how a structure worked, or that there was no removing nodes in this particular program and, thus, it was unnecessary. This allowed me to clear my mind and focus.

* How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This played a lot into my natural tendency to research anything and everything, but it helped to expand my working knowledge in knowing more about different data structures that I may not have known about in the past. At the same time, it’s allowing me to analyze best approaches more frequently than before. In the past, a lot of what I did was more I need something to do this and then I would do my research and come up with it. This now lets me approach the process a bit more analytically in, okay, I need a character to be able to move, how can I do that and more easily direct myself and ask the questions needed to get a better answer instead of going with the first thing that works from my research.

* How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project allowed me to see where code may be reused a bit more easily. Instead of rewriting code that may already be written, I can see what code would work and bring it in, making the necessary changes where needed, such as changing variables. This allowed me to more easily maintain code across multiple projects because I can better see flaws because they may appear and it allows me to make the code more readable by adding in comments as well.
